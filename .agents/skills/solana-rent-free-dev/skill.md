  Skill for Solana development using rent-free primitives from Light Protocol.
  Covers client development (TypeScript, Rust) and program development (Rust)
  across Anchor, native Rust, and Pinocchio. Focus areas include DeFi and
  Payments (Light Token, Light-PDA). Other use cases include airdrops and token
  distribution (Compressed Token), and user/app state plus nullifiers for
  payments and ZK applications (Compressed PDA).

## Capabilities

ZK Compression is a framework on Solana for stablecoin payment rails, consumer apps and defi. The Light SDK and API's let you create mint, token and PDA accounts >99% cheaper with familiar Solana developer experience.

### Primitives

| Primitive        | Use case                                                                                                                                                                                               | Constraints                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Light Token      | Most token use cases (launchpads, DeFi, payments). Rent-free mint and token accounts. \~200x cheaper than SPL and more compute-unit efficient on the hot path.                                         |                  |
| Light-PDA        | DeFi program state such as AMM pools and vaults. \~98% cheaper than PDAs and can be implemented with minimal code changes.                                                                             |                  |
| Compressed Token | Only for Airdrops and token distribution. Prefer Light Token for other purposes. Used by Light Token under the hood for rent-free storage of inactive Light Tokens. Supported by Phantom and Backpack. | Do not use for general-purpose token features. Use Light Token instead.        |
| Compressed PDA   | User state and app state, nullifiers (payments and ZK applications), DePIN nodes, and stake accounts. Similar to program-derived addresses without a rent-exempt balance.                              | Not for shared state, pool accounts, or config accounts. Use Light-PDA instead |

### Install

```bash theme={null}
npx skills add Lightprotocol/skills
```

## Workflow

1. **Clarify intent**
   - Recommend plan mode, if it's not activated
   - Use `AskUserQuestion` to resolve blind spots
   - All questions must be resolved before execution
2. **Identify references and skills**
   - Match task to available [skills](#defi) below
   - Locate relevant [documentation and examples](#documentation-and-examples)
3. **Write plan file** (YAML task format)
   - Use `AskUserQuestion` for anything unclear — never guess or assume
   - Identify blockers: permissions, dependencies, unknowns
   - Plan must be complete before execution begins
4. **Execute**
   - Use `Task` tool with subagents for parallel research
   - Subagents load skills via `Skill` tool
   - Track progress with `TodoWrite`
5. **When stuck**: spawn subagent with `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, DeepWiki MCP access and load `skills/ask-mcp`

## Context

- SPL to Light reference: https://zkcompression.com/api-reference/solana-to-light-comparison

### light-token

A token standard functionally equivalent to SPL that stores mint and token accounts more efficiently.

**Mint accounts** represent a unique mint and optionally store token-metadata. Functionally equivalent to SPL mints.

**Token accounts** hold balances from any light, SPL, or Token-2022 mint, without paying rent-exemption.

The token program pays rent-exemption cost for you. When an account has no remaining sponsored rent, the account is automatically compressed. Your tokens are cryptographically preserved as a compressed token account (rent-free). The account is loaded into hot account state in-flight when someone interacts with it again.

Use for: Stablecoin Orchestration, Cards, Agent Commerce, Defi, ... .

### light-PDA

The Light-SDK pays rent-exemption for your PDAs, token accounts, and mints (98% cost savings). Your program logic stays the same.

After extended inactivity (multiple epochs without writes), accounts auto-compress to cold state. Your program only interacts with hot accounts. Clients load cold accounts back on-chain via `create_load_instructions`.

| Area            | Change                                                          |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| State struct    | Derive `LightAccount`, add `compression_info: CompressionInfo`  |
| Accounts struct | Derive `LightAccounts`, add `#[light_account]` on init accounts |
| Program module  | Add `#[light_program]` above `#[program]`                       |
| Instructions    | No changes                                                      |

Use for: DeFi program state, AMM pools, vaults.

### Compressed token (only use for token distribution)

Compressed token accounts store token balance, owner, and other information of tokens like SPL and light-tokens. Compressed token accounts are rent-free. Any light-token or SPL token can be compressed/decompressed at will. Supported by Phantom and Backpack.

Only use for: airdrops, token distribution without paying upfront rent per recipient.

### Compressed PDA

Compressed PDAs are derived using a specific program address and seed, like regular PDAs. Custom programs invoke the Light System program to create and update accounts, instead of the System program.

Persistent unique identification. Program ownership. CPI between compressed and regular PDAs.

Use rent-free PDAs for: user state, app state, nullifiers for payments, DePIN node accounts, stake accounts, nullifiers for zk applications. Not for shared state, pool, and config accounts.

### Guidelines

- **light-token ≠ compressed token.** light-token is a Solana account in hot state. Compressed token is a compressed account, always compressed, rent-free.
- **light-PDA ≠ compressed PDA.** light-PDA is a Solana PDA that transitions to compressed state when inactive. Compressed PDA is always compressed, derived like a PDA and requires a validity proof.
- **light-token accounts hold SPL and Token-2022 balances**, not just light-mint balances.
- When sponsored rent on a light-token or light-PDA runs out, the account compresses. It decompresses on next interaction.
